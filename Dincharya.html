                <p><strong>Ayurveda </strong>emphasizes the importance of dinacharya or daily routine and ritucharya or seasonal routine.&nbsp; Both are instrumental in the prevention of disease and promotion of ideal health.&nbsp;In the present part we
                    will discuss personal hygiene, codes of conduct, and behavioral patterns in relation to dinacharya and ritucharya. With this knowledge you will see that personal hygiene is as important as social hygiene. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="post">
                <p>
                    The<strong> Sutra Sthana of Charaka</strong> describes swastha chatusk&nbsp; which means quadruplet on health. The first chapter is devoted to daily routine. Vagbhata devotes the second and third chapters of his classics to Dinacharya
                    and Rutucharya.&nbsp;Both Ancient Scientist emphasize preventive hygiene over curative medicine. Every one should take proper care of his body to maintain good health.<br/><br/> The daily routine as described by different classics
                    of Ayurveda is given below.&nbsp; You should always try to follow it.</p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Rising Early in morning</h3><br/>
                    <p> <em>Vagbhatta</em> advises rising at brahma muhurta, a very early period in the morning.It comes at about 4:00 a.m. to 5 a. m.&nbsp;Everyone should rise at this time and inhale a lot of fresh air.&nbsp; By so doing, you will feel fresh
                        the whole day. By being awake to receive their influence, you gain greater freshness, strength, and inclination for work. Those who have any sickness can sleep more.&nbsp; It is said &ldquo;Early to bed, early to rise makes a man
                        healthy, wealthy, and wise.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some people it is not advisable to get up early in the morning.&nbsp; These include people who suffer&nbsp;&nbsp; from insomnia, indigestion, fever, or diarrhea or who have duties
                        at night keeping them awake for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Evacuation</h3><br/>
                    <p>The second important daily routine is to evacuate the bowels and bladder. Many people have a bad habit of going to the toilet only after tea or breakfast.&nbsp; Evacuation first thing in the morning is preferable. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Natural evacuation of the bowels without any laxative or any other intake is always desirable.&nbsp; Evacuation once or twice a day is natural. If you are wake up in early in the morning , then it&rsquo;s a natural evacuation of bowels
                        &amp; bladder. Normally stool should not be very loose.&nbsp; It should be yellow, reddish, or blackish in color. Excessive yellow, black or green or red color in stool is always indicative of pathological condition.</p>
                    <p>There should be no mucous, fat, indigested particles or broken shape in the stool. They indicate digestive problems which may produce serious problems in forth coming days. Evacuation should not produce pain or strain.&nbsp; It is
                        necessary that the whole concentration of the mind not be diverted from evacuation.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>Cleaning of the Teeth and Tongue</h3><br/>
                    <p>The branches of certain trees are used for cleaning the teeth.&nbsp; These branches are cut into brush-size pieces.&nbsp; One end is crushed to make it soft and used to slowly brush the teeth.&nbsp; The green sticks with sap in them
                        are always preferable.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Toothpastes and powders which are sweet in taste are not recommended in Ayurveda. Sweets are generally not healthy for the teeth and gums.&nbsp; Ayurveda recommends herbal brushes for cleaning the teeth. These are bitter, pungent,
                        and astringent in taste. &nbsp;After take a food Cleaning of is must</p>

                        These types of herbal cleansers remove particles from the teeth and gums and foul smells or tastelessness from the mouth.&nbsp; They give strength to the teeth and gums. After cleaning the teeth, the next routine is tongue scraping&nbsp; Scraping cleans
                        the tongue and removes a coating that is produced by Ama.Tongue scrapers are made of silver, copper, , stainless steel, brass, or even gold .They should be blunt. If a scraper is not available, two fingers-index and middle can
                        be used to rub the tongue and clean it.&nbsp; Those people who may avoid tooth cleaning are those with acute cases of indigestion, vomiting, asthma, bronchitis, fever, facial paralysis, thirst, stomatitis, heart disease, or pain
                        in the head, eyes and ears.

                        is used daily, just as metals like gold can be cleaned with oil, brush, cloth and&nbsp; water&nbsp; wash until they are bright and gleaming.

                    <h3>Physical Exercises</h3><br/>
                    <p>It is defined as the movement of the physical organs of the body by which the body gets stretched.&nbsp; The classics of Ayurveda recommend daily physical exercise.&nbsp; Vagbhata says that proper exercise produces lightness in the
                        body, strength for work, increased gastric fire, and reduced fat.&nbsp; All parts become well developed and in good form.</p>
                    <p>Physical exercise should be done after oil massage so that the oil applied on the body gets&nbsp;absorbed through the pores of the skin and enters into the tissue level. Ayurveda recommends doing&nbsp;exercises only up to the point
                        of half your capacity.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>In the cold season and in spring it is advised to do exercises up to half depletion of energy, but in summer, rainy season and autumn, less than half of the energy should be consumed. Excessive exercise should not be done in any condition.&nbsp;
                        It may cause thirst, tuberculosis, asthma, hemorrhage, fatigue, cough, pyrexia, and vomiting.&nbsp; excess physical exercise (as well as excess coitus, night waking, and talking with a loud voice) is so harmful that it may even
                        cause the death of a person. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Those who should not exercise vigorously include people who suffer from Vata or Pitta disorders like arthritis, Hemiplegia, pyrexia, tendency toward internal hemorrhage, fainting, etc. also children below age ten, those older than
                        seventy, and pregnant women. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>There are different kinds of physical exercise described in Vedic and ancient Indian books.&nbsp; Many of these are suitable to a particular type of person or a particular type of condition, but some are generally&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>suitable for anyone.</p>

                    <h3>Meditation and Religious Act &nbsp;</h3><br/>
                    <p>In Vagbhata's chapter on Dinacharya, after describing the bath, he says that every creature wants to achieve happiness in their life, and that happiness cannot be achieved without following natural laws (dharma).</p>
                    <p>Religious or virtuous acts are described to enable us to follow the laws of nature.&nbsp; If we violate natural laws, we experience the consequence and fall sick.&nbsp; If we follow them we are always healthy. Everyone should structure
                        his morning and evening time to allow at least 20 to 40 minutes for self-realization, to obtain the knowledge of the unified field, which is the home of all the laws of nature.&nbsp; This is the key real health and all happiness.
                        &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Charaka said that all types of physical and psychic disorders are finally ended in yoga (union of self with universal unified field).&nbsp; Only then can people achieve real peace of mind and happiness. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>A great deal has been written on this subject in various yoga and religious books.&nbsp; Our purpose here is to present its relationship to perfect health and daily routine.&nbsp; Meditation properly practiced, is the most direct means
                        of experiencing the unified field.&nbsp; It leads to self-realization and ultimately all happiness in life.&nbsp;</p>

                        for sleep and rest, circulation and digestion are a little dull.&nbsp; The possibility for indigestion and ama production is greater if the load on gastric fire is excessive. Hence&nbsp; the advice to take a light meal in the evenings.

                        between 4:00 and 4:30 AM.</p>
                    <p>If there is any problem regarding sleep, you can rub ghee on the soles of the feet and then sponge them with cold water before going to bed.&nbsp; This promotes a deep natural sleep.&nbsp; Minor problems of sleep can be solved by an
                        ordinary remedy Wrap a thick cloth like a muffler around your forehead, covering temples and ears.&nbsp; Sleeping pills, tranquilizers and habit forming drugs should not be taken unless there is a serious reason for it and the
                        risk of taking them is lesser than the risk possible without them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
